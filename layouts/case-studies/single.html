		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<div class="text-block">
			<p>A large luxury lighting client wanted to grow their e-commerce footprint by adding their 2,000 product catalog to numerous online retailers. Their goal was to onboard as many retailers as possible within only a 4-month span. The major retailers included Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Wayfair. Each of these retailers had custom “portals” to enter and upload product data to be displayed on their respective websites. In addition, each retailer had numerous restrictions and guidelines for what time of media, such as photos, videos, and 3D models, that their particular platform supported.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Approach</h3>
		<div class="text-block">
			<p>Automation was the key to the quick onboarding of the large number of products required. Due to existing product data and media being inconsistent and unorganized, the first step was to automate the standardization of all product-related information for the full catalog. This was accomplished with a series of data scripts that ingested existing data and modified it to better suit e-commerce needs.</p>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges was the inconsistent media provided for the product catalog. Image issues included varying-sized images, poor image quality, inconsistent filenames, and missing images. Automated scripts helped resize and generate new images from existing files to help meet the standard required images for each e-commerce platform. In addition, we leveraged AI to help increase older images of lesser quality to ensure all images uploaded were of the best quality possible.</p>
			<p>In addition to product data and images, we also automated the batch translation of all product specification PDFs to ensure platform compliance for various languages were met. We accomplished this by using Google’s batch document translation services to bulk upload, translate, and modify over 4,000 PDFs. Our automation helped keep the cost of the total translation of files to only $75.</p>

		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<div class="text-block">
			<p>Over a three-month period, all of the client’s assets, data, and specification files were standardized and tweaked to best practice e-commerce standards. All 3 major e-commerce partners were fully updated with content and products in the projected 4-month period, allowing the client to hit their quarterly goals.</p>
			<p>After uploading the catalog to all e-commerce platforms, the client saw on average a 25% increase in e-commerce sales. The increase in sales for Home Depot saw the largest increase, growing to 75% by the end of the year.</p>
